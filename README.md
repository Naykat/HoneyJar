# HoneyJar
HoneyJar is an encryption that will make your messages or files protected

HoneyJar takes as an argument an alphabet(type: string) with letters that you will use in sentences you are going to encrypt

HoneyJar has 2 functions:

2) unbar(string) — decrypts string

If you have several classes with same alphabet, this classes can decrypt each other!
